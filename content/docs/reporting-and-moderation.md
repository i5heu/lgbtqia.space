When reporting accounts, please make sure to include at least a few posts that show rule-breaking behaviour, when applicable. If there is any additional context that might help make a decision, please also include it in the comment. This is especially important when the content is in a language nobody on the moderation team speaks.

We usually handle reports within 24 hours. Please mind that you are not notified when a report you have made has led to a punitive action, and that not all punitive actions are externally visible. For first time offenses, we may opt to delete offending content, escalating to harsher measures on repeat offenses.
